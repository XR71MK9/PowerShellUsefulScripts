# PowerShellUsefulScripts
A collection of custom PowerShell scrips that I have written to ease some of the daily requirements of IT tasks

A HUGE shout out to repository https://github.com/itsontheb/Get-OnlineSWVersions (and the correlating Reddit user himselF!) where I was able to learn about building a proper hash table.

These scripts are designed be informational-only in nature. They return version, publish date and download URL information. You can use them and set a particular variable for passthrough. Each has a "-quiet" parameter to just return the version number.

In my own environment, I use these as the basis for a daily email that goes out to the team highlighting different third party (3PUP) applications and their latest versions. You may find it of similar use if you don't have an enterprise 3PUP plugin or not system-driven, unified means of doing this ($$$). 

More to come soon!
